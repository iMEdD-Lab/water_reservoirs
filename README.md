We collected the water savings data by the OpenWaterAPI platform which provides historical open data on water savings and production by Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP) for Attica, Greece. 
From this information, we created and are providing a dataset that includes data on the daily water reserves, in cubic meters, in the reservoirs that supply the capital city of Athens, 
starting from January 1, 1985, and onwards â€” except for the Evinos reservoir, where data begins on December 26, 2001. The full dataset, which is freely available here, and will be updated monthly by the iMEdD team. 
In this first version, which we are publishing today, data is available up to July 10, 2025. The raw data from EYDAP is updated daily.
